Yes. this is a ~/.vim directory.

If you know what that is, you might be interested. Otherwise, you definitely have better things to look at.

Bootstrapping:

```
git clone https://github.com/matthewn/dotvim.git ~/.vim
git clone https://github.com/kristijanhusak/vim-packager ~/.vim/pack/packager/opt/vim-packager
```

There will be errors until you do (from inside vim):

```:PackagerInstall```
